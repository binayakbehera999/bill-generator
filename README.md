## Project Description

Speech Based Bill Generator is a speech based solution to generate a bill for the speech input given by the user. The Application asks the user for the item name and the quantity. After the user input, the application asks the user if the order is completed. Based on user input more items are added accordingly. Ultimately after the user is provided with the complete order, the application displays the bill. Initially it is developed for simple words and limited quantity. But it can be expanded further for a bigger area of words.   
      
The backend of the project is developed using C++/C in Visual Studio IDE, the frontend application and the web server is developed using Node.js and Flutter. It is build upon the core concept of Hidden Markov Model to store the properties of the speech sample and compare the new sample with these
properties to detect which word has been spoken.
